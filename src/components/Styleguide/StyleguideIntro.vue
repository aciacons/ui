		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>The basis for Kiva's web styleguide is Zurb's
			<a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/" target="_blank">Foundation for Sites</a>
			responsive front-end framework</p>

		<h2>Sensible HTML Element Defaults</h2>
		<p>Foundation provides a set of sensible defaults for all HTML elements by way of the
			<a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html#the-settings-file" target="_blank">
				_settings.scss</a>
			file. The nice thing about the settings file is that you can override it with your own
			<a href="https://github.com/kiva/ui/blob/master/src/assets/scss/_settings.scss" target="_blank">
				_settings.scss</a>
			file.</p>

		<p><i>* We only use the scss portion of the Foundation toolset, opting not to include any of their
		javascript or any components that depend on that inclusion.</i></p>

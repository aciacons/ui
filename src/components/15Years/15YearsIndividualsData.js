			Zaaqi Johnson had long dreamed of being his own boss. As a young entrepreneur with a passion for creating delicious, nutritious, high-quality food, imaging himself as an entrepreneur excited him. After spending years working for others in the food service industry, Zaaqi decided it was time to make his dream a reality.
			</p><p>
			Zaaqi recognized his talent for cooking many years ago. He worked in various food service positions before attending Monroe Community College’s Culinary Arts program in Rochester, New York. He was working at a local resort hotel where he was responsible for Sunday brunch, during which the restaurant typically served 150-200 people. Other than the occasional acknowledgement from friendly patrons, he had very little to show for the labor he was putting in while working for someone else.
			</p><p>
			This experience convinced Zaaqi that he possessed the skills and the stamina required to run his own restaurant. To start, he sold dinners to family and friends out of his mom’s kitchen, advertising through social media. He then used the money from those dinner sales to rent and renovate a restaurant space. His family and friends pitched in, too, both financially and physically. Together, they renovated and prepared the space soon to be Zoc’s.
			</p><p>
			In 2016, Zaaqi opened Zoc’s Gourmet Burgers and Shakes – a made-to-order casual dining restaurant – on the West Side of Rochester. His goal is to offer healthy food choices to his community, food that is prepared with the care and quality that urban residents have traditionally felt the need to travel to the suburbs to enjoy. In turn, he is committed to giving back to the community by using locally-sourced produce, meats, and baked goods from the neighborhood farmer’s market and family-owned bakery. Customers who choose to dine at Zoc's Gourmet can be sure they are eating food of the highest quality.
			</p><p>
			Zaaqi used his Kiva loan on marketing materials to help drive traffic to and grow his new restaurant. He designed a logo and branding, and printed fliers, mailers, and to-go food packaging. Zaaqi and his team were also able to use their Kiva funds to increase Zoc’s Gourmet’s social media presence through their primary website, zocsgourmet.com, as well as through GrubHub and Google+. Finally, Zaaqi used the remainder of his Kiva loan to improve the appearance and visibility of the Zoc’s Gourmet storefront, namely upgrading the business sign to enhance visibility from the street. These improvements were instrumental in helping Zoc’s Gourmet to grow as a business and become a staple in the West Rochester community.
			</p><p>
			Zaaqi has never been afraid of the hard work running his own restaurant requires. Rather, he is encouraged by the idea that his hard work contributes directly to the success of his business. And a success it is. The community has been incredibly supportive and reviews of Zoc’s are exceedingly positive. Congratulations, Zaaqi!

			Meet Nilda! As a married mother of six children, she works hard to support her family. Nilda lives in the Philippines, where she owns a nipa (a stilt house indigenous to the Philippines) roofing business and earns additional income from raising pigs.
			</p></p>
			Nilda borrowed 30,000 Philippine Pesos through long-time Kiva Field Partner Negros Women For Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), her 12th loan from NWTF, to buy nipa leaves, bamboo sticks, and other materials to continue to grow her business. She hopes that her hard work, along with a helping hand from NWTF and Kiva, will help her achieve her dream to save enough money to pay for her children’s college tuition.
